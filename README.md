# Coordinated Quadratic Funding

The main code is in [CQF.ipynb](https://github.com/filyp/coordinated-quadratic-funding/blob/main/CQF.ipynb).

## Open questions

- Can we make the leverages predictable, so that everyone KNOWS for certain they will get the leverage they signed up for? This would prevent strategic thinking, and also make people more willing to trust this system.
- How to choose function parameters to maximize leverages and total pot size?
